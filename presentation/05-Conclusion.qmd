## Additional Methods

There are new methods for quasi-experiments coming out frequently! The staggered adoption setting, non-binary treatments, and inferential approaches are especially hot research areas.

. . .

Other quasi-experimental methods include:

-   Interrupted time series
-   Instrumental variables
-   Regression discontinuity

## Uses and Advantages in Epidemiology

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Can use routine data
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Fewer covariates required
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Evaluate population-level impacts
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Clear interpretations/different set of assumptions
:::

## Challenges/Limitations in Epidemiology

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   ATT is not usually target
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Limited generalizability
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Still require untested assumptions
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Limited inferential methods
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in-then-semi-out}
-   Limited research on integrating with other study designs
:::

## Research Needed

::: incremental
-   Which epi settings are conducive to these methods? Which are not?

-   How do we translate the statistical/causal assumptions into meaningful subject-matter questions?

-   Which of these advanced methods are most useful in epi? How should they be selected in principled ways?
