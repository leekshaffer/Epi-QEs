## Motivating Example: COVID-19 Vaccine Mandates

## Question

What happens when multiple units adopt the intervention at different times?

Different states adopted COVID-19 vaccine mandates for state employees at different times.

# Staggered Adoption

## Panel Data Setting

-   Multiple units, treated at different time points

-   Multiple time points

## Two-Way Fixed Effects Model

::: callout-caution
The TWFE model can accommodate this:

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \theta I(X_{it} = 1)+\epsilon_{it}
$$

But as written it assumes **treatment effect homogeneity** across time periods, time-on-treatment, and units.

# Challenge: Heterogeneity

## Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

In many settings, especially in epidemiology, heterogeneity is common, especially with non-randomized adoption.

What might cause heterogeneity in the effect of a state employee COVID-19 vaccine mandate?

## Weighted Average of Effects

## Time-Varying Effects

## Goodman-Bacon Decomposition

The TWFE model estimates a weighted average of all 2x2 comparisons.

![Goodman-Bacon (2021), Figure 6.](images/Adv_DID/Goodman-Bacon%20Fig6.png){fig-alt="A scatterplot of 2x2 DID estimates, ranging from -30 to 30, by weights, ranging from 0 to 1.2." fig-align="center"}

## Goodman-Bacon Decomposition

This is equivalent to a weighted average of all unit-period-specific treatment effects, with some having negative weights.

![Goodman-Bacon (2021), Figure 7.](images/Adv_DID/Goodman-Bacon%20Fig7.png){fig-alt="Scatter plot of weights for each treatment group, ranging from -0.15 to 0.30, by treatment time, ranging from 1969 to 1985." fig-align="center"}

# Proposed Solutions

## Group-Time ATT

Let

$$
ATT(g,t) = E[Y_{it}(g) - Y_{it}(0)],
$$

the group-time ATT in period $t$ for a unit first treated in period $g$, compared to if it had never been treated (or not yet treated by period $t$).

. . .

Many solutions boil down to considering which group-time ATTs should be included in the estimand, how they differ, and how to weight them.

TWFE assumes $ATT(g,t) = \theta$ for all $g \le t$.

## Dynamic Specification

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \sum_{k \neq 0} \delta_{k} I(K_{it} = k)+\epsilon_{it},
$$

where $K_{it}$ is the lead/lag for unit $i$ in period $t$ (e.g., $K_{it} = 1$ in the first exposed period).

See [Borusyak and Jaravel (2018)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/borusyak/files/borusyak_jaravel_event_studies.pdf) and [Borusyak et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdae007). Captures time-on-treatment heterogeneity.

## Interaction-Weighting

We can account for timing cohort heterogeneity as well by further allowing the effect to vary by adoption timing group ($G_i$):

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{k \neq 0} \delta_{g,k} I(G_i = g) I(K_{it} = k) + \epsilon_{it}
$$

. . .

Various methods use this approach, and differ in which comparisons/observations they allow and how they combine results.

## Restricting Controls

See [Sun and Abraham (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.006) use the interaction-weighting approach with a clean "control" $C$ that is either never-treated or last-treated.

This avoids forbidden comparisons.

Their regression approach then implicitly weights by population share in each timing group.

## Restricting Periods: First-Difference

Another approach would only consider one switching effect. For each time period $t$ with at least one unit untreated at $t-1$ and treated at $t$ and at least one unit untreated at both $t-1$ and $t$, compute:

$$
\widehat{DID}_{+,t} = \frac{1}{N_{1,0,t}} \sum_{i:D_{i,t}=1,D_{i,t-1}=0} \left( Y_{i,t} - Y_{i,t-1} \right) - \frac{1}{N_{0,0,t}} \sum_{i:D_{i,t}=D_{i,t-1}=0} \left( Y_{i,t} - Y_{i,t-1} \right)
$$

Average these across all time periods $t$, weighted by number of units or individuals.

See [de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20181169) and [de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ectj/utac017).

## Restricting Periods: Last Pre-Treated

[Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.001) propose to estimate $\widehat{ATT}_{g,t}$ for each timing group $g$ and period $t$ using a non-parametric scheme compared to the last pre-treatment period: suggested approaches are IPW, OR, and DR.

Then summarize to an overall average effect weighted by $w_{g,t}$:

$$
\theta = \sum_{g \in \mathcal{G}} \sum_{t=2}^T w_{g,t} ATT_{g,t}.
$$

## Generalized 2x2 Building Blocks

More generally, can weight across all 2x2 DID comparisons, with weights chosen to target a specific estimand.

$$
\hat{\theta} = \sum_{i,i',t,t'} \left[ \left( Y_{i,t'} - Y_{i,t} \right) - \left( Y_{i',t'} - Y_{i',t} \right) \right]
$$

# Other Challenges

## Parallel Trends and Covariates

These are complicated by staggered adoption and the longer time frames implied by panel data. Recent work has focused on how to interpret and test for these assumptions and how to incorporate time-varying covariates.

## Other Assumptions and Limitations

The no-anticipation (or known/limited anticipation) assumption still must hold, as must the no-spillover assumption.

. . .

All of these approaches change the precise specification of the estimand as well: the **ATT** must be interpreted in terms of the included time periods, lags, and units, and how they are weighted.

## When is DID useful? When is it lacking?

::: callout-important
It's easy to ignore the fundamentals when using the more advanced methods. Consider the validity of the data, the question being asked, and the feasibility of the effect.
:::

## Recommendations

::: incremental
-   Consider data source carefully

-   Think about possible heterogeneities and desired estimand

-   Use graphical displays and diagnostics to assess possible biases

-   Consider multiple estimation methods for robustness

-   Pre-specify, and explore with appropriate caveats
