## Setting

-   Two (or more) units: some treated/exposed, some untreated

-   Two (or more) time periods: some prior to first treatment, some after

. . .

::: callout-tip
## Example: South London "Grand Experiment" from [Coleman 2024](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3696028)

Untreated: Southwark & Vauxhall Districts (12)

Treated: Joint Southwark & Vauxhall/Lambeth Districts (16)

Time Periods: 1849 (pre-treatment) and 1854 (post-treatment) outbreaks
:::

## Potential Outcomes and Treatment Effect

| Unit          | Pre-Treatment        | Post-Treatment       |
|---------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| **Exposed**   | $Y_{10} = Y_{10}(0)$ | $Y_{11} = Y_{11}(1)$ |
| **Unexposed** | $Y_{00} = Y_{00}(0)$ | $Y_{01} = Y_{01}(0)$ |

. . .

Treatment Effect:

$$\theta = E[Y_{11}(1) - Y_{11}(0)]$$

## Change Over Time

Within each unit, we have an interrupted time series:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta_1 &= Y_{11} - Y_{10} \\
\Delta_0 &= Y_{01} - Y_{00}
\end{aligned}
$$

. . .

::: callout-tip
## Key Idea

Use the observed $\Delta_0$ under control as the potential outcome for the unobserved $\Delta_1$ under treatment.
:::

## Two-by-Two DID

$$
\begin{aligned}
\hat{Y}_{11}(1) &= Y_{11} \\
\hat{Y}_{11}(0) &= Y_{10} + \color{darkgreen}{(Y_{01} - Y_{00})} \\
\hat{\theta} &= \color{purple}{(Y_{11} - Y_{10})} - \color{darkgreen}{(Y_{01} - Y_{00})} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Two-by-Two DID: Example

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
require(knitr)
load(file="../data/cholera.Rda")
## Summarize across districts:
chol_2x2 <- regdata %>%

                         levels=c("SouthwarkVauxhall_Lambeth",
                                  "SouthwarkVauxhall",
                                  "Diff, Treated-Untreated"),
                         labels=c("Joint Southwark & Vauxhall/Lambeth (Treated)",
                                  "Southwark & Vauxhall Only (Untreated)",
                                  "Diff, Treated-Untreated"))) %>%

                   N=n())
## Format into table:

  dplyr::filter(Supplier=="Southwark & Vauxhall Only (Untreated)") %>% 
  dplyr::select(`1849 Deaths per 10,000`,`1854 Deaths per 10,000`)
## Combine into table and calculate differences between time periods:
chol_2x2_res <- chol_2x2_f %>% dplyr::select(-c(`Sub-Districts`)) %>%
  add_row(cbind(Supplier="Diff, Treated-Untreated",diffs)) %>%
  mutate(`Diff, 1854-1849`=`1854 Deaths per 10,000`-`1849 Deaths per 10,000`)

## Controlled ITS

Compare to other possible estimates of $\hat{Y}_{11}(0)$:

::: incremental
-   $Y_{10}$: assumes no time trends

-   $Y_{01}$: assumes no differences in units

-   Modeled trend for $Y_{1t}$ over time: requires time model and more data

-   Regress $Y_{1t}$ on $Y_{0t}$: requires covariates, additional control units, and/or specific model
:::

# Details and Assumptions

## Regression Formulation

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \theta I(X_{it} = 1)+\epsilon_{it},
$$

where:

-   $\alpha_i$ is the fixed effect for unit $i$,

-   $\gamma_t$ is the fixed effect for time $t$,

-   $\epsilon_{it}$ is the error term for unit $i$ in time $t$, and

-   $X_{it}$ is the indicator of whether unit $i$ is treated at time $t$.

. . .

::: callout-note
This is called the **two-way fixed effects (TWFE) model** for DID.
:::

## Statistical Inference

Inference can be conducted using the TWFE regression model. This accounts for variability in the outcome if there are multiple treated/untreated units and multiple periods.

Generally, the standard errors are *clustered* by unit to account for correlation. This can also be done with a *block-bootstrap* variance estimation.

. . .

::: callout-caution
This accounts for *statistical uncertainty* but not *causal uncertainty* in the model assumptions. Those cannot be fully assessed statistically.
:::

## Key Assumptions

::: incremental
-   Parallel trends (in expectation of potential outcomes):

    $$
    E[\color{purple}{Y_{11}(0) - Y_{10}(0)}] = E[\color{darkgreen}{Y_{01}(0) - Y_{00}(0)}]
    $$

-   No spillover

-   No anticipation/clear time point for treatment
:::

## Assessing Parallel Trends

Placebo/specification tests:

::: incremental
-   In-time: conduct the same DID analysis on a time period prior to the actual treatment initiation

-   In-space: conduct the same DID analysis as if an untreated unit were the treated one

-   Alternative outcome: conduct the same DID analysis on an outcome that should not be affected by the treatment
:::

## Assessing Parallel Trends

These approaches can be used either:

::: incremental
-   as a heuristic justification for the assumption,

-   to obtain a null distribution for permutation tests, or

-   to adjust the estimate for the "null" effect (difference-in-difference-in-differences or triple-differences).
:::

## Improving Assumptions: Re-scale

Changing the scale of the outcome changes the parallel trends assumption. The most common transformation is to use the **natural log**.

E.g., $\log(Y_{it}) = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \theta I(X_{it}=1) + \epsilon_{it}$

. . .

Changes parallel trends assumption to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
E[\color{purple}{\log Y_{11}(0) - \log Y_{10}(0)}] &= E[\color{darkgreen}{\log Y_{01}(0) - \log Y_{00}(0)}] \\
E \left[ \log \left( \color{purple}{\frac{Y_{11}(0)}{Y_{10}(0)}} \right) \right] &= E \left[ \log \left( \color{darkgreen}{\frac{Y_{01}(0)}{Y_{00}(0)}} \right) \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

## Improving Assumptions: Re-scale

::: callout-caution
-   Only one scale can actually have parallel trends

-   This changes the estimand (e.g., additive -\> multiplicative)

    See [Kahn-Lang and Lang (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/07350015.2018.1546591) for more considerations and [Feng and Bilinski (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.04.08.24305335) for examples of different scales/specifications.
:::

## Improving Assumptions: Covariates

Incorporating covariates makes the parallel trends assumption *conditional* on those covariates.

E.g., $Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \theta I(X_{it}=1) + \beta Z_{i} + \epsilon_{it}$

Changes parallel trends assumption to:

$$
E[\color{purple}{Y_{11}(0) - Y_{10}(0)} ~ | ~ Z_1] = E[\color{darkgreen}{Y_{01}(0) - Y_{00}(0)} ~ | ~ Z_0]
$$

## Improving Assumptions: Covariates

::: callout-caution
-   This makes the parallel trends assumption more complex to consider and requires modeling covariates

-   This changes the estimand and assumes the effect is homogeneous across covariates

    See [Caetano and Callaway (2023)](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2202.02903) for issues that arise with time-varying covariates.

# Epidemiologic Considerations

## ATT Estimand

::: callout-important
## Estimand Interpretation

DID estimates the **Average Treatment Effect on the Treated (ATT)**.

This may not be generalizable to other units, including the untreated units in the study.
:::

## Internal vs. External Validity

-   Internal validity may be high if the assumptions are justified.

-   External validity may be low because of limited transportability of the ATT and limited information on effect heterogeneity.

## Bias vs. Variance

-   Incorporating additional units/periods can reduce variance, but may also risk violating the assumptions

-   Generally conducted with limited, carefully-selected units: low bias but high variance

. . .

::: callout-note
## Examples

-   More distant vs. closer untreated units

-   Incorporating more untreated units

-   Incorporating more recent time periods
