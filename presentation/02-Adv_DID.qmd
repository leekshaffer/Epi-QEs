-   Multiple units, treated at different time points

-   Multiple time points of observations

## Two-Way Fixed Effects Model

::: callout-caution
The TWFE model can accommodate this *statistically*:

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \theta I(X_{it} = 1)+\epsilon_{it}
$$

But as written it assumes **treatment effect homogeneity** across time periods, time-on-treatment, and units: there is a single treatment effect $\theta$.
:::

# Challenge: Heterogeneity

## Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

In many settings, especially in epidemiology, heterogeneity is common, especially with non-randomized adoption.

## Weighted Average of Effects

![Goodman-Bacon (2021), Figure 1.](images/Adv_DID/Goodman-Bacon%20Fig1.png){fig-alt="Line plot (schematic) of outcomes over time for two units treated at different times with different responses to intervention and one untreated unit." fig-align="center"}

## Weighted Average of Effects

This complicates the interpretation of the estimand: it is still an **ATT**, but now that average is a weighted average that depends on the number of units at each switch point and the number of periods observed.

## Weighed Average of Effects: Simplified Example

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Plot of three-unit staggered adoption example with outcomes"
#| fig-alt: "A line plot of an early adopter who gains 1 unit of outcome by treatment, a late adopter who gains 3 units of outcome by treatment, and a non-adopter."
WAE <- tibble(Time=rep(c(1:5), 3),
              Unit=factor(rep(c("Early","Late","None"), each=5),
                          levels=c("None","Early","Late"),
                          labels=c("U","k","l")),
              X=factor(c(0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0)),
              Y=c(4,5,7,8,9,1,2,3,7,8,0,1,2,3,4))

ggplot(WAE, mapping=aes(x=Time, y=Y, group=Unit, color=Unit,
                        shape=X)) + 
  geom_point() + geom_line() + theme_bw() +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(0,10,by=2), minor_breaks=0:10) +
  coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0,10))
```

## Weighed Average of Effects: Simplified Example

Using all periods:

$$
\theta = \frac{1+1+1+3+3}{5} = 1.8
$$

Using only the first four periods:

$$
\theta = \frac{1+1+3}{3} \approx 1.67
$$

## Weighted Average of Effects: Regression Estimates

Using all periods:

```{r}
lm1 <- lm(Y~Time+Unit+X, data=WAE)
coef(lm1)
```

Using only the first four periods:

```{r}
lm2 <- lm(Y~Time+Unit+X, 
          data=WAE %>% filter(Time < 5))
coef(lm2)
```

## Weightings

If all units are of the same size/variance, per Goodman-Bacon (2021) Thm. 1:

$$
s_{kU} \propto \bar{D}_k (1-\bar{D}_k) \\
s^k_{k \ell} \propto (\bar{D}_k -\bar{D}_\ell) (1-\bar{D}_k) \\
s^\ell_{k \ell} \propto (\bar{D}_k -\bar{D}_\ell) (1-\bar{D}_\ell)
$$

where $\bar{D}$ is the proportion of periods treated.

## Weighted Average of Effects: In Regression Estimator

Using all periods:

$$
\bar{D}_k = 3/5, \quad \bar{D}_\ell = 2/5 \\
s_{kU} \propto 6/25, \quad s_{\ell U} \propto 6/25 \\
s^k_{k \ell} \propto 2/25, \quad s^\ell_{k \ell} \propto 2/25 \\
\hat{\theta} = \frac{6 \cdot 1 + 6 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 3}{6 + 6 + 2 +2} = 2
$$

## Weighted Average of Effects: In Regression Estimator

Using only the first four periods:

$$
\bar{D}_k = 2/4, \quad \bar{D}_\ell = 1/4 \\
s_{kU} \propto 2/16, \quad s_{\ell U} \propto 2/16 \\
s^k_{k \ell} \propto 2/16, \quad s^\ell_{k \ell} \propto 1/16 \\
\hat{\theta} = \frac{2 \cdot 1 + 2 \cdot 3 + 2 \cdot 1 + 1 \cdot 3}{2 + 2 + 2 + 1} \approx 1.857
$$

## Time-Varying Effects

![Goodman-Bacon (2021), Figure 3.](images/Adv_DID/Goodman-Bacon%20Fig3.png){fig-alt="A line plot where two lines start coinciding in the first period, diverge in the second period as one grows faster than the other, and then become parallel in the third period." fig-align="center"}

## Forbidden Comparisons

The weights on treatment effects can be non-convex (i.e., negative) if there are **time-varying treatment effects**.

This gives an uninterpretable TWFE estimand, and can even switch the sign of the estimate.

. . .

Time-varying effects can be broadly categorized into:

-   **Dynamic treatment effects** that depend on how long a unit has been treated, and

-   **Calendar time effects** that differ for all units based on the period of observation.

Both can be problematic, although calendar time effects can be handled similarly to unit-varying effects.

## Goodman-Bacon Decomposition: General

::: callout-note
## Goodman-Bacon (2021), Eqn 15

$$
plim_{N \to \infty} \hat{\theta} = \beta^{DD} = VWATT + VWCT - \Delta ATT,
$$

where:

$VWATT$ is the variance-weighted ATT (as in computation above),

$VWCT$ is the variance-weighted deviation from parallel trends, and

$\Delta ATT$ is the weighted sum of changes in the treatment effect within timing groups.
:::

## Goodman-Bacon Decomposition: 2x2s

::: callout-note
## Goodman-Bacon (2021), Theorem 1

$$
\hat{\theta} = \sum_{k \neq U} \hat{\beta}^{2 \times 2}_{kU} + \sum_{k \neq U} \sum_{\ell > k} \left[ s^k_{k \ell} \hat{\beta}^{2 \times 2,k}_{k \ell} + s^\ell_{k \ell} \hat{\beta}^{2 \times 2,\ell}_{k \ell} \right]
$$

where:

$\hat{\beta}^{2 \times 2}_{kU}$ is a comparison of timing group $k$ to untreated $U$,

$\hat{\beta}^{2 \times 2,k}_{k \ell}$ is a comparison of an early-treated group $k$ to a late-treated group $\ell$ in the time between the two switches, and

$\hat{\beta}^{2 \times 2,\ell}_{k \ell}$ is a comparison of a late-treated group $\ell$ to an early-treated group $k$ in the time after $\ell$ switched.

## Goodman-Bacon Decomposition of DID Comparisons

The TWFE model estimates a weighted average of all 2x2 DID comparisons.

![Goodman-Bacon (2021), Figure 6.](images/Adv_DID/Goodman-Bacon%20Fig6.png){fig-alt="A scatterplot of 2x2 DID estimates, ranging from -30 to 30, by weights, ranging from 0 to 1.2." fig-align="center"}

## Goodman-Bacon Decomposition of Treatment Effects

We can observe the overall weight given to each treatment timing group, which may be negative if it is more often used as a control than a treated group.

![Goodman-Bacon (2021), Figure 7.](images/Adv_DID/Goodman-Bacon%20Fig7.png){fig-alt="Scatter plot of weights for each treatment group, ranging from -0.15 to 0.30, by treatment time, ranging from 1969 to 1985." fig-align="center"}

## Issues with TWFE

::: incremental
(1) Under unit-varying treatment effects, $VWATT$ may not be a readily interpretable average of effects (and some may get negative weights).

(2) Under any individual deviations from parallel trends (even if average does not deviate), $VWCT$ may not be 0.

(3) Under time-varying treatment effects, $\Delta ATT \neq 0$: can result in negative weights on some effects.
:::

:::: {.fragment .fade-in}
::: callout-warning
Negative weights on some treatment effects *can* lead to averages outside of the range, or even a changed treatment effect sign.

# Proposed Solutions

## Possible Solutions

(1) Restricting Observations
    (a)  Exclude timing-only comparisons
(2) Restricting Periods
    (a) First differences only
    (b) Last pre-treated only
(3) Dynamic Specifications
(4) Explicit Weightings

## 1. Restricting Observations

One approach to avoiding forbidden comparisons is restricting the observations used to fit the model.

[Borusyak et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdae007) fit this model using only the not-yet-treated observations. They then use that to derive counterfactual outcomes for comparison.

. . .

[Sun and Abraham (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.09.006) use the approach with a clean "control" $C$ that is either never-treated or last-treated. Their regression approach then implicitly weights by population share in each timing group.

## 1. Restricting Observations

::: {.column width="50%"}
Advantages:

-   Simple to implement

-   Straightforward interpretations for each treated unit
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Disadvantages/Limitations:

-   Still opaque weighting of unit- or time-varying effects

-   Throws out potentially valuable information: inefficient
:::
:::::

## 2a. Restricting Periods: First-Difference

Use only the immediate switching effect. For each time period $t$ with at least one unit untreated at $t-1$ and treated at $t$ and at least one unit untreated at both $t-1$ and $t$, compute:

$$
\begin{align*}
\widehat{DID}_{+,t} = \frac{1}{N_{1,0,t}} &\sum_{i:D_{i,t}=1,D_{i,t-1}=0} \left( Y_{i,t} - Y_{i,t-1} \right) \\
&- \frac{1}{N_{0,0,t}} \sum_{i:D_{i,t}=D_{i,t-1}=0} \left( Y_{i,t} - Y_{i,t-1} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

## 2a. Restricting Periods: First-Difference

![](images/Adv_DID/FirstDiff.png){fig-alt="Schematic of staggered adoption design. Only the last untreated (white) block and first treated (green) blocks in each row are highlighted for comparison."}

## 2a. Restricting Periods: First-Difference

Average these switcher estimates across all time periods $t$, weighted by number of units or individuals.

See [de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20181169) and [de Chaisemartin and d'Haultfoeuille (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ectj/utac017), or crossover estimate in [Kennedy-Shaffer et al. (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1002/sim.8451).

## 2b. Restricting Periods: Last Pre-Treated

[Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jeconom.2020.12.001) propose to estimate $\widehat{ATT}_{g,t}$ for each timing group $g$ and period $t$ using a non-parametric scheme compared to the last pre-treatment period: suggested approaches are IPW, OR, and DR.

Then summarize to an overall average effect weighted by $w_{g,t}$:

$$
\theta = \sum_g \sum_{t=2}^T w_{g,t} ATT_{g,t}.
$$

## 

## Group-Time ATT

Let

$$
ATT(g,t) = E[Y_{it}(g) - Y_{it}(0)],
$$

the group-time ATT in period $t$ for a unit first treated in period $g$, compared to if it had never been treated (or not yet treated by period $t$).

. . .

Many solutions boil down to considering which group-time ATTs should be included in the estimand, how they differ, and how to weight them.

TWFE assumes $ATT(g,t) = \theta$ for all $g \le t$.

## Dynamic Specification

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \sum_{k \neq 0} \delta_{k} I(K_{it} = k)+\epsilon_{it},
$$

where $K_{it}$ is the lead/lag for unit $i$ in period $t$ (e.g., $K_{it} = 1$ in the first exposed period).

See [Borusyak and Jaravel (2018)](https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/borusyak/files/borusyak_jaravel_event_studies.pdf) and [Borusyak et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1093/restud/rdae007). Captures time-on-treatment heterogeneity.

Also useful to test for "pre-trends" in single intervention time setting.

## Interaction-Weighting

We can account for timing cohort heterogeneity as well by further allowing the effect to vary by adoption timing group ($G_i$):

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \gamma_t + \sum_g \sum_{k \neq 0} \delta_{g,k} I(G_i = g) I(K_{it} = k) + \epsilon_{it}
$$

. . .

Various methods use this approach, and differ in which comparisons/observations they allow and how they combine results. This implies different assumptions and bias-variance tradeoffs.

## Generalized 2x2 Building Blocks

More generally, can weight across all 2x2 DID comparisons, with weights chosen to target a specific estimand and then minimize variance.

$$
\hat{\theta} = \sum_{i,i',t,t'} w_{i,i',t,t'} \left[ \left( Y_{i,t'} - Y_{i,t} \right) - \left( Y_{i',t'} - Y_{i',t} \right) \right]
$$

# Other Challenges

## Parallel Trends and Covariates

These are complicated by staggered adoption and the longer time frames implied by panel data. Recent work has focused on how to interpret and test for these assumptions and how to incorporate time-varying covariates.

## Other Assumptions and Limitations

The no-anticipation (or known/limited anticipation) assumption still must hold, as must the no-spillover assumption.

. . .

All of these approaches change the precise specification of the estimand as well: the **ATT** must be interpreted in terms of the included time periods, lags, and units, and how they are weighted.

## When is DID useful? When is it lacking?

::: callout-important
It's easy to ignore the fundamentals when using the more advanced methods. Consider the validity of the data, the question being asked, and the feasibility of the effect.
:::

## Recommendations for Staggered Adoption

::: incremental
-   Consider data source carefully

-   Think about possible heterogeneities and desired estimand

-   Use graphical displays and diagnostics to assess possible biases and trade-offs

-   Consider multiple estimation methods for robustness to different assumptions

-   Pre-specify, and explore with appropriate caveats
